## The first function takes a matrix as input and creates a list of functions to
## set and get the matrix and its inverse. Then, the second function takes that 
## list to calculate the inverse of the matrix or take it from the cache if it 
#3 has been already calculated

## Creates a list of 4 functions to set and get the matrix and its inverse
